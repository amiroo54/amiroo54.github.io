            <article>
                <p>in this article im gonna explain some of the very basic coding concepts with a very simple language.</p>
                <p>first, we have variables. variables are containers that store a value. they can have types like int (for whole numbers), string (for texts), float (for decimal numbers), etc. here are some examples: </p>
                <code data-language="js">let x = 10;</code>
                <code data-language="python">hello = "hello world!"</code>
                <code data-language="java">private int x = 69;</code>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    as you can see, different languages really dosn't differ that much.
                    in this example "let" and "private" are the keywords to describe what access level of variable is gonna be made, both are private variables meaning they can't be access everywhere in the code.
                    int keyword is for the type of the variable. python and javascript are loose typed languages so they don't need type declaration.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>the second concept im gonna showcase in this article is operators. operators, as their name implly, do some operation on values. for example:</p>
                <code data-language="js">let y = x - 10;</code>
                <code data-language="python">print(x + 34)</code>
                <code data-language="c++">x += 10;</code>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    here we first have y variable getting asigned the value of x minus 10, which is 0 (we defined x a little while back).
                    second one prints (which just means outputing into the terminal) x + 34 and the third one just means x = x + 10.
                </p>
                <p>i hope as a first introdution to coding in general, this article was helpful to you. i will see you in the next article where we talk about functions and what are they used for.</p>
