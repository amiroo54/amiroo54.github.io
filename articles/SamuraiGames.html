                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Sekiro, shadows die twice.</h2>
                        <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814380/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1678991267">
                        <p>sekrio, well known for it's difficulty is one of fromsoftware games that brings joy to the player and people who watch the gameplay. the combanitaion of attacks and parries and countless abilities make for a great and replayable exprience.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Wo long, the fallen dynasty</h2>
                        <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1448440/capsule_616x353.jpg?t=1698913433">
                        <p>wo long, though as not difficult or well known as sekiro is still a must try game for samurai fans. the shear amount of weapons types: swords, axes, glavies, dual-swords, hammers, etc gives it the most replayablility out of all these 4 games. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Ghost of tsushima</h2>
                        <img src="https://www.suckerpunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GOTkeywidecrop.jpg">
                        <p>ghost of tsushima is one of the most beautiful games ever made. it follow the story of jin sakai trying to defend the lands of tsushima from attack of the mongols. unfortunatly, at the time of writing this it is only available on ps4 and ps5 so if you don't have one of them your out of luck.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>skulls of shogun</h2>
                        <img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/228960/header.jpg?t=1638440485">
                        <p>skulls of shogun is the least known game out of these 4. it's an strategy game that takes place in the japanese after life where you are a dead commandar and have to use your soliders to defeat the enemies while enjoying the cartony graphics.</p>
