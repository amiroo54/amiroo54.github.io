this is a website that i made for three reasons:
1- to learn making websites.

2- to have a kind of resume to show off.

3- to prove a point.



if you want to copy the structure (yes there is one) you just have to change the colors in css file root part for the colors and copy two line with script and div stuff for the header in each file. the rest is yours.
